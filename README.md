`Pkcs11` - bindings to the PKCS#11 cryptographic API [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cryptosense/pkcs11.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cryptosense/pkcs11) [![docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/doc-online-blue.svg)](https://cryptosense.github.io/pkcs11/doc/)
====================================================

This library contains ctypes bindings to the PKCS#11 API.

This API is used by smartcards and Hardware Security Modules to perform
cryptographic operations such as signature or encryption.

The entry point of this library is [P11.load_driver]. An example is available in
`test/example_sign.ml`.
