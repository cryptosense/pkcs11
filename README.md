PKCS#11 is an API used by smart cards and Hardware Security Modules to perform
cryptographic operations such as signature or encryption.

This library is made of several packages:

- `pkcs11`: type definitions corresponding to the PKCS#11 API
- `pkcs11-cli`: a library exposing Cmdliner arguments used to initiate a PKCS#11 session
- `pkcs11-driver`: bindings to emit calls to a PKCS#11 DLL
- `pkcs11-driver.fake`: a fake PKCS#11 DLL that returned hardcoded values, used for testing
- `pkcs11-rev`: reverse bindings to write OCaml PKCS#11 implementations

The entry point of this library is `P11.load_driver`. Examples are available in
`test/examples/`.
